Forest Flipper
----------------
By AMarEst


A 2D platformer inspired by VVVVV

Red Hood has to make her way through the enchanted forest while dodging magic fireballs and hungry wolfs to get to her granny's house. 

Luckily for her, the forest will help by flipping gravity to get through some tough spots.

Will she get there before nightfall or will she perish trying? Good luck.
